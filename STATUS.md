## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests

- [ ] Run `--help` (shows help)
- [ ] Run `--version` (shows version)
- [ ] Run in repo with changes (creates commit)
- [ ] Run with `--conventional` (asks type/scope/subject)
- [ ] Run with `--simple` (asks one question)
- [ ] Run with `--no-lint` (skips linting)
- [ ] Run with config file (uses config)
- [ ] Run without gh CLI (shows manual link)

### Edge Cases

- [ ] No changes (shows "working tree clean")
- [ ] No package.json (still works)
- [ ] No commitlint (uses simple mode)
- [ ] No lint/format scripts (skips silently)
- [ ] Invalid config (shows validation error)

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Architecture Lessons

1. **Start Simple** - Complex architecture isn't always better
2. **Auto-Detection Wins** - Less config = better UX
3. **Graceful Degradation** - Tools should never break
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complexity when needed
5. **User First** - Always think about the developer

### Code Lessons

1. **Type Safety Matters** - TypeScript catches bugs early
2. **JSDoc is Enough** - Don't over-comment
3. **Small Files** - Easy to understand and maintain
4. **Clear Names** - Code should be self-documenting
5. **Test Early** - Build and test as you go

### Product Lessons

1. **Solve Real Problems** - PR creation is tedious
2. **Make It Fast** - < 30 seconds is the goal
3. **Never Break** - Graceful fallbacks everywhere
4. **Beautiful Output** - Colors and spinners matter
5. **All Skill Levels** - Beginner to advanced

## 💡 Key Features Explained

### Auto-Detection Magic

```typescript
// Detects package manager from lock files
pnpm-lock.yaml → pnpm
yarn.lock → yarn
package-lock.json → npm

// Detects commit format from commitlint
commitlint.config.ts exists → conventional
No commitlint → simple

// Detects scopes from structure
apps/web → "web" scope
packages/ui → "ui" scope
```

### Smart Defaults

```typescript
// No config needed!
{
  commit: {
    format: 'auto-detected',
    scopes: 'auto-detected',
    maxLength: 100
  },
  hooks: {
    lint: 'auto-detected',
    format: 'auto-detected'
  },
  pr: {
    base: 'auto-detected',
    draft: false
  }
}
```

### Graceful Fallbacks

```typescript
// Everything has a fallback
No gh CLI? → Show manual link
No lint? → Skip silently
No config? → Use defaults
Error? → Helpful message
```
